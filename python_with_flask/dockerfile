# Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Step 4: Install the dependencies from requirements.txt
RUN pip instaWll --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Expose the port that Flask will run on
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 6: Run the unit tests (optional, but this runs them at build time)
# Note: You can also skip this part if you want to run the tests manually after the image is built
RUN python -m unittest discover -s tests

# Step 7: Define the command to run your Flask app
CMD ["python", "python_with_flask/app.py"]


# Believe I just needed a dockerfile from the Readme but if I needed a docker image and container I would run the below commands
# docker build -t my-flask-app .
# docker run -p 8080:8080 my-flask-app
